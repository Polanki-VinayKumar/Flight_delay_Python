# Flight Delay Prediction Using Python: A Data-Driven Approach

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting flight delays exceeding 120 minutes using historical flight data. By leveraging key variables such as airline carriers, airport operations, and weather conditions, the model aims to provide actionable insights for airlines and passengers to optimize travel planning.

The first step in developing this predictive model involves conducting thorough research gap analysis to understand existing studies and methodologies. This helps in identifying effective machine learning techniques and data preprocessing strategies for accurate flight delay prediction.

Once relevant datasets are acquired, the data cleaning and preprocessing phase begins using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas. This includes handling missing values, analyzing descriptive statistics, and visualizing key trends using data visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

After preparing the dataset, the next step is implementing regression models to predict flight delays. This involves selecting the most suitable machine learning algorithms to ensure high accuracy.

The final phase of the project focuses on building an interactive dashboard using Python. This dashboard will provide real-time insights and visual analytics, making it easier for users to explore flight delay patterns and make informed decisions.

By incorporating data science techniques, predictive modeling, and visual analytics, this project aims to enhance flight delay forecasting, benefiting both passengers and airlines in managing travel disruptions efficiently.
